# Twake Calendar Frontend

![LOGO](assets/calendar.svg)

## Goals

This project aims at service a Single Page Application allowing a user to interact with its calendar.

This frontend-only application will interact with:

 - [esn-sabre](https://github.com/linagora/esn-sabre/) CalDAV + CardDAV server, tailor made for LINAGORA needs.
 - [Twake Calendar side service](https://github.com/linagora/twake-calendar-side-service) that delivers additional backend features for Sabre.

It is meant as a drop in replacement of [esn-frontend-calendar](https://github.com/linagora/esn-frontend-calendar).

## Roadmap

The Minimum Viable Product involves all features currently used in production for **esn-frontend-calendar**.

It includes basic calendaring features and shared / delegated calendar capacity.

After completing the MVP which should be done ~Q1 2026 we will work on additional integrations (viso, drive), resources, tasks, and much more exciting features.
